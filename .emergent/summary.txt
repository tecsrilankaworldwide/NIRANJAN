The AI engineer successfully navigated a complex request, evolving from a pixel-perfect clone of a non-responsive website to building a comprehensive dual-platform educational system. Initially, facing a 403 error for tecaikids.com, the engineer used web search and user clarification to understand the project's scope, including previous work with another agent and local GitHub files. The process involved iterative frontend development with mock data, followed by full-stack integration of a FastAPI backend and MongoDB. Key decisions included splitting the platform into TecaiKids (4-12) and Teen Academy (12-16), incorporating corporate branding (TEC Sri Lanka Worldwide), LKR pricing, and specific content (logical/algorithmic thinking). The engineer diligently corrected age group specifications based on user feedback and prepared a complete deployment package for Hostinger, providing detailed upload instructions.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to create a pixel-perfect clone of tecaikids.com, matching its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure across devices. Due to the original site's inaccessibility (403 error), the requirement evolved. The user desired a comprehensive educational platform for Sri Lankan children. This transformed into a dual-platform system:
1.  **TecaiKids Platform (Ages 4-12):** Divided into 4-6 (Preschool), 7-9 (Elementary), and 10-12 (Middle) age groups. Features include age-specific courses, logical thinking modules across all levels, and algorithmic thinking for 10-12.
2.  **Teen Academy (Ages 12-16):** Divided into 12-13 (Early Teen) and 14-16 (Advanced Teen) age groups. Features include advanced coding, AI, robotics, mobile app development, digital entrepreneurship, career prep, and algorithmic thinking.
Both platforms require TEC Sri Lanka Worldwide (Pvt.) Ltd corporate branding, LKR pricing, Stripe integration for payments, inclusion of physical materials in quarterly packages, and a functional contact form. The final product should be ready for deployment to Hostinger.
